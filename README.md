In this project,I use three tables to store datas.If you want to quickly build the database,you can download the [database file](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24995023/culturalshop.sql) and import it to your MySQL.  
* **Table:goods**  
This table stores the information of goods.

| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| id | int(11) | true | true | null | goods_id |
| category | varchar(255) | false | false | null | goods_category |
| info | varchar(255) | false | false | null | goods_infomation |
| title | varchar(40) | true | false | null | goods_name |
| price | decimal(10,2) | true | false | null | goods_price |
| src | varchar(255) | true | false | null | goods_image_URL |
| sales | int(11) | false | false | null | goods_sales_number|
* **Table:order**  
This table stores the information of user orders.  

| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| id | int(11) | true | true | null | order_id |
| UID | varchar(30) | true | true | null | user_id |
| goods | json | true | false | null | order_goods_group |

| price | decimal(10,2) | true | false | null | order_price |
| crete_time | timestamp | true | false | null | order_create_time |
* **Table:user**  
This table stores the information of user.This table don't need to store the password because I use WeChat to login,and WeChat provides a unique ID for each user,therefore I use it to identify the user.

### MVC Architecture
This project used MVC architecture, so there are these several parts.
* **Controller**  
This part is the entry point of the project, it receives requests from the front-end and returns responses,and it calls the service layer to process the request.
* **Service**  
This part is the core part of the project, it implements the business logic, and it calls the Mapper layer to access the database.
* **Mapper**  
This part is the data access layer, it implements the database operations, and it is used by the service layer,and it is generated by MyBatis.
* **Domain**
This part is the domain model, it is the entity class of the project, and it is used by the service layer and the controller layer.
